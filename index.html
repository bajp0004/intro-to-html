    <p>My name is Diya, I am a first year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. I pursued graphic design because of my passion for arts and design. I would like to work in the film and/or music industry as a Graphic Designer. I look forward to what this program has to offer.
    </p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Ottawa, but my parents are both from India. I have a dog named Shaahi, short for Shahenshah, who is a Yorkshire Terrier. He turned 5 on January 22, 2025. I love him very much! </p>
